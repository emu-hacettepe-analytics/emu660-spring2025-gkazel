# 1. Project Overview and Scope

The labor force participation rate, income level, public representation, perception of safety, educational attainment, and regional disparities are multidimensional factors affecting women's socioeconomic status in Turkey. Particularly in regions where a patriarchal social structure prevails, women face both structural and cultural barriers to participating in economic and social life. This situation not only restricts individual well-being but also limits the country’s overall development potential.

This project aims to analyze the socioeconomic status of women in Turkey through a data-driven approach using multidimensional indicators such as educational attainment, income level, perception of safety, and social roles. The core framework of the project includes examining the relationship between women’s education levels and their income, analyzing labor force participation rates in the context of regional disparities, evaluating how individual perceptions such as safety are shaped by gender roles, and generating public policy recommendations based on all these data.
